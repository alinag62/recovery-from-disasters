 June 24, 2021: Amir, Stephanie, Ishan, Alina\n\nSummary. During the kick-off meeting we discussed how to assess feasibility of the project: which data on firms to search for, which data on disaster to access. We also talked through potential prioritising of some countries that suit our goals best.\n\n1. Data on earthquakes:\n*why earthquake magnitudes don’t always correlate with damage size\n*Alina needs to get an event-level data from Stephanie\n*Alina needs to read data descriptions on this data\n*we may go from just earthquakes to other disasters (hurricanes, floods)\n\n2. Data on firms\n*we potentially want panels with disaggregated firm-level investments; facility-level investments; entrances/exits of firms; productivity; firm sizes\n*we may first explore which variables those panel datasets usually have\n*we may potentially explore different relative sizes of disaster shocks in “small” and “large” countries \n*Alina needs to look through macro papers and see what datasets they use for different countries\n\n3. Prioritising countries\n*identifying countries that are most stricken by earthquakes - Stephanie has annual(?) country-level data on a number of events over a specific threshold\n*EMDat identifying list of the countries affected by earthquakes, hurricanes, floods\n\n4. Formal tasks\n*setting up slack\n*setting up access to RCC Midway folder\n*having an ongoing to-do list and a meeting summary document\n*syncing data with server\n\n\n2. July 9, 2021: Stephanie, Alina\n\nSummary. Stephanie told Alina about data on earthquakes on Box, and also referred to the papers that Alina should read to better understand data and different measures of earthquakes. \n\n1. Data on earthquakes:\n*Stephanie told about main event-level dataset and its variables of interest\n*Stephanie shared 2 papers that may help understand the data\n*Stephanie also shared raw data on shake maps\n*We also talked about Significant Earthquakes list and Worldbank data\n*Alina needs to read papers\n*Alina needs to document data, at least a preliminary paragraph is fine\n\n\n3.  July 29, 2021: Amir, Alina\n\nSummary. We discussed next steps regarding data access and understanding how much different data sources overlap. We also touched upon relevant papers.\n\n*Data on firms:\n*Amir will send out letters that Alina wrote and other edited\n*Alina should access data that she can access right now\n*Alina needs to understand which variables and years overlap in the available data\n\n2.    Literature review:\n*Alina should write short summaries of papers that Ishan sent (esp. highlight why this may be relevant to us)\n*Alina will search for alternative literature: e.g. macro or IO papers on disasters\n\n\n4. August 12, 2021: Amir, Stephanie, Ishan, Alina\n\nSummary. We discussed all the progress we made during the last few weeks: data, literature. We discussed our main next goals: aligning earthquakes and firms data to one geo-level. \n\n1.    Data tasks:\n*Ishan will share data on India, Indonesia, Columbia and also provide guidance for geo-merging \n*Stephanie will work with Alina to aggregate earthquakes' data to ADM2(?) level, since most firm data does not have identified locations\n*Alina will run basic regressions / produce plots with the main goal of understanding if one can see earthquakes' impact on any firms' characteristics for data we can already access\n\n2.    Literature review:\n*Alina will write a page summarising all papers she read since now it is separate paragraphs for each paper; it is unclear how different papers relate to each other now\n*Main result: there is a very limited literature that took the same approach as we want (firms microdata + natural disasters recovery + macro framework)\n\n\n5. August 17, 2021: Stephanie, Alina \n\nSummary. Stephanie guided Alina through her previous Matlab code she used for aggregating earthquakes' data to chosen regions. The code is basically ready to use for our project. Stephanie made several changes to the code to better tailor it to our needs during the call, together with Alina. Alina only needs to do a few manipulations with regions data shape files to finally run it.\n\n1.    Data tasks:\n*Alina needs to write a code that creates a raster map, where each cell has 2 attributed: district ID and total area of that district\n\n\n6. August 19, 2021: Stephanie, Alina \n\nSummary. Stephanie guided Alina through code with earthquakes' spatial aggregation. They made necessary changes.\n\n7. August 20, 2021: Stephanie, Alina \n\nSummary. Stephanie guided Alina through code with earthquakes' spatial aggregation. They made necessary changes.\n\n8. September 1, 2021: Stephanie, Alina \n\nSummary. We discussed a few things related to the codes, Stephanie shared the next step in her code.\n\n\n9. September 20, 2021: Stephanie, Alina\n10. September 21, 2021: Stephanie, Alina\n\nSummary. The population (urban/rural/unpopulated) data is added to the shaking files.\n\n11. September 23, 2021: Amir, Alina\n\nSummary. Alina presented a few draft summary stats and regression results. Amir advised Alina how to develop those into a real summary statistics.\n\n1. Shaking data:\n*adding nightlights or other density measures (in addition to grump)\n*how to think about the exposure in the right way? eg: mpga_aw10 spans top 10% of the area in terms of mpga, but what if 2 regions are large and tiny? should we set some other absolute parameter (km2 instead of % of area?) ; weighted by population? \n*how many lags should we use in regressions?\n*do we even include the year t in the regression? do we only include lags? what if the earthquake happens in the beginning of the year? calculate the \"average weighted\" date of the earthquake?\n\n2. Summary stats:\n*compare shaking/characteristics in firms with locations and in regions without identified locations\n*increase the number of lags for regressions\n*write down the equations for the regressions\n*classify existing vars for Colombia. Choose the ones that are more suitable, esp ones in quantities rather than dollars\n*plot figures of raw data (shaking vs non-shaking year; time-series of prioritised variables vs shaking measures) \n\n\n12. September 30, 2021: Amir, Alina\n\nSummary. Alina presented new summary stats and regression results. Amir advised Alina how to develop those.\n\n*Summary stats:\n*adding intensity, not just frequency of shaking in each region\n*few comments on the way graphs look\n*doing similar graphs for other countries rather than just Columbia\n\n\n\n13. October 7, 2021: Amir, Stephanie, Ishan, Alina\n\nSummary. Alina shared the intermediate results of preliminary analysis of raw data. We all discussed several questions: which earthquake measurement is better to use, how to proceed with regressions, how to deal with some of the data issues (like lacking adm2 in Colombian firm data)\n\n1. Choosing the earthquake measurement:\n*we came to a conclusion that using measurements that exclude unpopulated areas is preferred\n*we discussed that using constant areas instead of top 10% most shaking-prone areas would lead to additional data issues. We decided to use averages across 100% district's area as the main measurement for now\n\n2. Choosing the right regression specification:\n*running with lags, up to 10, iteratively, and reporting results\n*running with different earthquake treatments (total area, top10%area, populated only, population weighted area, urban/rural areas)\n\n\n14. November 5, 2021: Amir, Alina\n\n15. November 12, 2021: Amir, Alina\n\n16. November 22, 2021: Stephanie, Alina\n\n17. December 7, 2021: Amir, Stephanie, Ishan, Arti\n\n*FROM US: list of countries for earthquake and hurricane exposure\n*arti mentions: chile, peru, colombia (with better resoltuion on the data), indonesia, turkey (restricted), mexico (restricted), romania (firms with tax IDs), croatia\n*Potentially 30 countries in total\n*feb 28: we need methodological note, annotated outline, descriptive with one country\n*end of june: one rough draft to show that we are working\n*first meeting of September: we need to have all data compiled, cleaned and ready for any analysis\n*end of october: draft for world bank working paper series - polished and journal-ready\n*NEXT STEPS: check with indonesia, share dataset. We give list of variables and they clean for us.\n*for feb deadline: methodology note, and paper outline\n*clarify about the contract\n*who is the RA - contract for that person\n*paid by days or hours and coming directly from bank contract\n*lump sum division\n*if we have any questions, we can email arti\n*can arti send the excel of the available data?\n*Pick a second country to have a buffer for feb deadline\n\n\n18. December 9, 2021: Amir, Alina \n\n1. Documenting inconsistent results of regressions using coefficient plots\n*make a document; list potential problems; say what you can did/will do to deal with them  \n\n2. List of priority countries for hurricanes\n*IBTrACS data\n*downloading and plotting data\n*checking data for duplicates\n\n \n19. December 14, 2021: Amir, Alina \n\n\n20. January 13, 2022: Amir, Ishan, Arti, Alina \n\n1. Next steps for the methodological note (deadline: Feb 28, to get the first tranche of the grant. Arti mentions that it's possible to get a part of the grant in advance if there is a need):\n*Alina will receive the dataset from Arti on Indonesia\n*we discussed what the note should include (note on methods/descriptives/analysis + all the codes); using newly obtained dataset on Indonesia\n*the codes should be easily reproducible for any other potential data source; fully commented\n\n2. Future steps:\n*we discussed accessing other countries in the future (Chile, Mexico!!, Vietnam)\n*some data is restricted and Alina will need to send the code that can be run remotely by someone else (such as Mexican data)\n*we will need to ask for a shapefile beforehand when we work with restricted data; we will be sending out codes in a few steps (a) descriptives (b) analysis\n*trying different cutoffs for the number of employees when harmonising data across countries; different sources treat those cutoffs differently\n*using different geographical levels (we can do a separate analysis when some data has a finer geographical identifier than adm2)\n*running separate analysis for different industries (manufacturing/services) since different data sources cover different industries\n*?using worldbank enterprise surveys (but they have restricted unrepresentative samples of firms and for many countries it's more of a cross-section rather than panel)\n\n3. Disasters data:\n*next step: producing tropical cyclones data on adm2(?) level from ibtracs \n\n\n21. January 24, 2022: Amir, Ishan, Stephanie, Arti, Alina \nSummary. Alina posed questions regarding data on Indonesia, Arti suggested to contact the RA that worked with this data previously. We discussed which measures of EQs we should use for February note. We discussed which summary stats and graphs to use for February note. \n\nFebruary note:\n*Spatial matching of the firm data (get data from Arti)\n*List of plots/summary stats (added to to-do list)\n\n\n22. January 25, 2022: Amir, Alina \nSummary. Discussing how to produce winds around tropical cyclones' eyes to consequently implement the damage model for countries.\n\n\n23.

February 28, 2022: Amir, Ishan, Stephanie, Arti, Alina\n\nNext steps:\n*defining categories of the firms (size) - when do we define the size (before the shock or at a specific year)\n*cleaning Vietnam data (wrong spatial identifiers previously - reassign)\n*writing up the algorithm for the cyclones\n\n28. March 21, 2022: Amir, Ishan, Stephanie, Arti, Alina\n\nNext steps:\n*create maps with Vietnam outcomes: number of firms, production, labor\n*adding regressions with size dummies\n*comparing firms in t-1: those that exit and those that don't\n\nPotential differences between EQs and cyclones:\n*aid (more after EQs, not really after cyclones) ?\n*spatial patterns (EQs tend to be smaller than cyclones(\n*type of damage (few spots that get 100% damage for EQs vs many small damages done by cyclones)\n\n\n29. March 25, 2022: Amir, Alina\n\nNext steps:\n*defining firms' size based on the specific year (Vietnam, 1996)\n*checking if spatial match for Vietnam is correct\n*adding size interaction to regressions in Indonesia\n*Vietnam: running cyclones regressions\n\n30.

May 19, 2022: Stephanie, Alina\n\nStephanie shares a do-file with Jorda method and explains how to test how many lags to include\n\nNext steps:\n*check if there is autocorrelation on adm2 level for both types of disasters\n\n37. May 23, 2022: Amir, Ishan, Stephanie, Arti, Alina\n\nNext steps:\n*comparing average treatment vs local projections\n*check how 2007-2008 data differs from the rest of the dataset for Vietnam (since VAs and some costs are not reported in these years - can we just drop them?)\n*get a do-file from Arti on labor decomposition with entry and exit\n\n38. June 2, 2022: Stephanie, Alina\n\nNext steps:\n*producing more years for cyclones to add to local projections (since autocorrelation goes past 10th lag for Vietnam and other countries)\n\n39. June 6, 2022: Amir, Ishan, Stephanie, Arti, Alina\n\nNext steps:\n*adding a longer panel for Vietnam\n*negative capital in data on Indonesia from WB\n*searching policies with different temporal roll-out related to aid after disasters\n*adding local projections to regressions with exposure dummies\n*running the same regressions for India as for Indonesia and Vietnam\n\n40. June 13, 2022: Amir, Ishan, Stephanie, Arti, Alina\n\nNext steps:\n*first meeting of September: we need to have all data compiled, cleaned and ready for any analysis\n*end of June: what analysis we can do and what data we have (country-specific list)\n*make a list of data (variables, years, ...)\n*why is there so much autocorrelation for cyclones??\n*does raw data have autocorrelation - to understand whether a problem is with raw data or my algorithm\n*write up a paragraph of results (or a table with +/-/0 and stars)\n*summary of all datasets\n\n\n41. June 27, 2022: Amir, Ishan, Stephanie, Alina\n\nJune draft:\n*create an excel sheet where you summarize all possible analyses, statuses and problems (so that we can easily check where we are on a country-disaster level)\n*send it out to the chat by tomorrow\n\nSerial autocorrelation of cyclones:\n*running additional diagnostics (plotting raw data) to understand what causes these patterns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","attribs":"*4*7*c+2*4+1*4*7*p+1*4*7*c+18*4|2+2*4*k*7*p+8*4*7*p+6q*4*p|2+2*4*7*p+2*4+1*4*7*p+k*4*p|1+1*4*2*a*3+1*4*7*p+1t*4*p|1+1*4*p*2*a*3+1*4*7*p+1h*4*p|1+1*4*2*a*3+1*4*7*p+1e*4*p|1+1*4*p*2*a*3+1*4*7*p+1z*4*p|1+1*4|1+1*4*7*p+g*4|1+1*4*p*2*a*3*6+1*4*7*p+44*4*p|1+1*4*p*2*a*3+1*4*7*p+1y*4*p|1+1*4*p*2*a*3+1*4*7*p+2w*4*p|1+1*4*p*2*a*3+1*4*7*p+2n*4*p|2+2*4*7*p+p*4*p|1+1*4*p*2*a*3*6+1*4*7*p+48*4*p|1+1*4*p*2*a*3+1*4*7*p+2b*4*p|2+2*4*7*p+f*4*p|1+1*4*p*2*a*3+1*4*7*p+g*4*p|1+1*4*p*2*a*3+1*4*7*p+12*4*p|1+1*4*p*2*a*3+1*4*7*p+1n*4*p|1+1*4*p*2*a*3+1*4*7*p+o*4*p|1+1*4|2+2*4*7*c+x|1+1*4|1+1*4*k*7*p+9*4*7*p+4v*4|2+2*4*7*p+n*4|1+1*4*2*a*3+1*4*7*p+23*4|1+1*4*2*a*3+1*4*7*p+1n*4|1+1*4*2*a*3+1*4*7*p+18*4|1+1*4*2*a*3+1*4*7*p+1w*4|1+1*4*2*a*3+1*4*7*p+q*4|1+1*4*2*a*3+1*4*7*p+1y*4|3+3*4*7*c+u*4|2+2*4*k*7*p+9*4*7*p+3y*4|2+2*4*2*5*3*6+1*4*7*p+e*4|1+1*4*2*a*3+1*4*7*p+1o*4|1+1*4*2*a*3+1*4*7*p+1i*4|1+1*4*2*a*3+1*4*7*p+29*4|2+2*4*7*p+o*4|1+1*4*2*a*3+1*4*7*p+30*4|1+1*4*2*a*3+1*4*7*p+2a*4|3+3*4*7*c+k*4*c+t*4|2+2*4*k*7*p+9*4*7*p+4r|1+1*4|1+1*4*7*p+h*4|1+1*4*2*a*3+1*4*7*p+2m*4|1+1*4*2*a*3+1*4*7*p+3r*4|1+1*4*2*a*3+1*4*7*p+50*4|2+2*4*7*p+o*4|1+1*4*2*a*3+1*4*7*p+4n*4|1+1*4*2*a*3+1*4*7*p+d*4+22*4*7*p+1s*4|3+3*4*7*c+11*4|2+2*4*k*7*p+9*4*7*p+af*4|2+2*4*7*p+h*4|1+1*4*2*a*3+1*4*7*p+3o*4|3+3*4*7*c+k*4*c+h*4|2+2*4*k*7*p+9*4*p+9*4*7*p+2m*4|2+2*4*7*c+k*4*c+h*4|2+2*4*k+8*4*k*7*p+1*4*p+9*4*7*p+1u*4*p+s*4|2+2*4*7*c+13*4|2+2*4*k*p+8*4*k*7*p+1*4*7*p+2j*4|3+3*4*7*c+13*4*c|1+1*4*7*c+14*4|2+2*4*k*7*p+9*4*7*p+24*4|2+2*4*7*c+z*4|2+2*4*k*7*p+8*4*7*p+3u*4|2+2*4*7*p+2*4+1*4*7*p+d*4|1+1*4*2*a*3*9+1*4*7*p+1v*4|1+1*4*2*a*3+1*4*7*p+6w*4|1+1*4*2*a*3+1*4*7*p+17*4|1+1*4*2*a*3+1*4*7*p+5b*4|2+2*4*7*p+h|1+1*4*2*a*3+1*4*7*p+2r*4|1+1*4*2*a*3+1*4*7*p+17*4|1+1*4*2*a*3+1*4*7*p+18*4|1+1*4*2*a*3+1*4*7*p+3b*4|1+1*4*2*a*3+1*4*7*p+35*4|3+3*4*7*c+z*4|2+2*4*k*7*p+8*4*7*p+2r*4|2+2*4*2*5*3*6+1*4*7*p+e*4|1+1*4*2*a*3+1*4*7*p+1q*4|1+1*4*2*a*3+1*4*7*p+z*4|1+1*4*2*a*3+1*4*7*p+1u*4|4+4*4*7*c+l*4*c+t*4|2+2*4*k*7*p+9*4*7*p+7m*4|2+2*4*7*p+2*4+1*4*7*p+10*4|1+1*4*2*a*3+1*4*7*p+2j*4|1+1*4*2*a*3+1*4*7*p+5r*4|2+2*4*7*p+1b*4|1+1*4*2*a*3*6+1*4*7*p+1r*4|1+1*4*2*a*3+1*4*7*p+3m*4|3+3*4*7*c+x*4*c|2+2*4*7*c+y*4*c|2+2*4*7*c+13*4*c|2+2*4*7*c+m*4*c+m*4*7*c+6*4|2+2*4*2*a*3+1*4*p+1s*4|1+1*4*2*a*3+1*4*p+4l*4|1+1*4*2*a*3+1*4*p+x*4|1+1*4*2*a*3+1*4*k*p+3*4*k*7*p+3*4*p+26*4|1+1*4*2*a*3+1*4*p+1k*4|1+1*4*2*a*3+1*4|1+2q*4*2*a*3+1*4*p+2e*4|1+1*4*2*a*3+1*4*p+2p*4|1+1*4*2*11*3*6+1*4*p+1h*4|1+1*4*2*11*3*6+1*4*p+q*4|1+1*4*2*11*3*6+1*4*p+14*4|1+1*4*2*11*3*6+1*4*p+1o*4|1+1*4*2*11*3*6+1*4*p+h*4|1+1*4*2*11*3*6+1*4*p+17*4|1+1*4*2*11*3*6+1*4*p+1a*4|1+1*4*2*11*3*6+1*4*p+1j*4|3+3*4*7*c+y*4|2+2*4*7*p+22*4|1+1*4*2*a*3+1*4*7*p+2i*4|2+2*4*7*p+18*4|1+1*4*2*a*3+1*4*7*p+c*4|1+1*4*2*a*3+1*4*7*p+t*4|1+1*4*2*a*3+1*4*7*p+s*4|2+2*4*7*p+1*4|1+1*4*c+1*4*7*c+1*4*c+b*4*7*c+2*4*c+k*4|3+3*4*7*c+2*4*c+2*4*7*c+7*4*c+1*4*7*c+2*4*c+5*4*7*c+1*4*c+d*4*7*c+6*4*c+8*4|2+2*4*7*p+2*4+1*4*7*p+12*4*k*7*p+1m*4*7*p+2i*4*k*7*p+1*4*7*p+1*4|1+1*4*2*a*3+1*4*7*p+1h*4|1+1*4*2*a*3+1*4*7*p+3w*4|1+1*4*2*a*3+1*4*7*p+2k*4|2+2*4*7*p+g*4|1+1*4*2*a*3+1*4*7*p+3*4*p+24*4|1+1*4*2*a*3+1*4*7*p+3g*4|1+1*4*2*a*3+1*4*7*p+4b*4|1+1*4*2*a*3+1*4*7*p+3y*4|1+1*4*2*a*3+1*4*7*p+3k*4|1+1*4*2*a*3+1*4*7*p+3n*4|1+1*4*2*a*3+1*4*7*p+4m*4|2+2*4*7*p+i*4|1+1*4*2*a*3+1*4*7*p+22*4|3+3*4*7*c+2*4*c+2*4*7*c+7*4*c+1*4*7*c+2*4*c+5*4*7*c+1*4*c+d*4*7*c+h*4*c+8*4|1+1*4*k*7*p+9*4*7*p+79*4|2+2*4*k*7*p+e*4|1+1*4*2*a*3+1*4*7*p+1i*4|1+1*4*2*a*3+1*4*7*p+1d*4|3+3*4*7*c+2*4*c+2*4*7*c+7*4*c+1*4*7*c+2*4*c+5*4*7*c+1*4*c+e*4|1+1*4*k+8*4*k*7*p+1*4*7*p+3c*4|3+3*4*7*c+2*4*c+2*4*7*c+7*4*c+1*4*7*c+2*4*c+5*4*7*c+1*4*c+d*4*7*c+h*4*c+8*4|1+1*4*k*7*p+8*4|2+2*4*k+e*4|1+1*4*2*a*3+1*4*7*p+31*4|1+1*4*2*a*3+1*4*7*p+1q*4|1+1*4*2*a*3+1*4*7*p+1f*4|1+1*4*2*a*3+1*4*7*p+k*4|2+2*4*7*c+2*4*c+2*4*7*c+a*4*c+5*4*7*c+1*4*c+1*4*7*c+h*4|3+3*4*7*c+2*4*c+2*4*7*c+a*4*c+5*4*7*c+1*4*c+1*4*7*c+1*4*c+b*4*7*c+h*4*c+7*4|2+2*4*k+d*4*k*7*p+g*4*k+1*4|1+1*4*2*a*3+1*4*k*7*p+i*4*7*p+1z*4|1+1*4*2*a*3+1*4*7*p+v*4|1+1*4*2*a*3+1*4*7*p+2u*4|1+1*4*2*a*3+1*4*7*p+s*4|3+3*4*7*c+2*4*c+2*4*7*c+b*4*c+5*4*7*c+1*4*c+1*4*7*c+1*4*c+b*4*7*c+h*4*c+7*4|2+2*4*k*p+d*4*k*7*p+g*4*k*p+1*4|1+1*4*2*a*3+1*4*7*p+17*4|1+12*4*2*a*3+1*4*7*p+n*4|2+2*4*k*7*p+n*4|1+1*4*2*a*3+1*4*7*p+b*4|2+2z*4*k*7*p+b*4|1+1*4*2*a*3+1*4*7*p+1g*4|1+1*4*2*a*3+1*4*7*p+22*4|1+1*4*2*a*3+1*4*7*p+1s*4|2+2*4*7*c+2*4*c+2*4*7*c+b*4*c+5*4*7*c+1*4*c+1*4*7*c+1*4*c+b*4*7*c+h*4*c+7*4|2+2*4*k+b*4|1+1*4*2*a*3+1*4*7*p+31*4|1+1*4*2*a*3+1*4*7*p+1z*4|1+1*4*2*a*3+1*4*7*p+15*4|2+2*4*7*c+2*4*c+2*4*7*c+8*4*c+5*4*7*c+1*4*c+1*4*7*c+1*4*c+b*4*7*c+h*4*c+7*4|2+2*4*k*p+b*4|1+1*4*2*a*3+1*4*7*p+1x*4|1+1*4*2*a*3+1*4*7*p+10*4|1+1*4*2*a*3+1*4*7*p+1o*4|2+2*4*k*7*p+1b*4|1+1*4*2*a*3+1*4*7*p+1d*4|1+1*4*2*a*3+1*4*7*p+1j*4|1+1*4*2*a*3+1*4*7*p+2m*4|3+3*4*7*c+2*4*c+2*4*7*c+8*4*c+5*4*7*c+1*4*c+1*4*7*c+1*4*c+b*4|2+2*4*k+b*4|1+1*4*2*a*3+1*4*7*p+1r*4|1+1*4*2*a*3+1*4*7*p+1c*4|1+1*4*2*a*3+1*4*7*p+1f*4|1+1*4*2*a*3+1*4*7*p+11*4|2+2*4*7*c+2*4*c+2*4*7*c+8*4*c+5*4*7*c+1*4*c+1*4*7*c+1*4*c+b*4*7*c+h*4*c+7*4|2+2*4*k+b*4|1+1*4
